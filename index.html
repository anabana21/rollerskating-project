                <h2>Why Rollerskating?</h2>
                <h3>Rollerskating, the joy of life</h3>
                <p>
                    Roller skating is the act of travelling on surfaces with roller skates. It is a recreational activity, a sport, and a form of transportation. Roller rinks and skate parks are built for roller skating, though it also takes place on streets, sidewalks, and bike paths.
Roller skating originated in the performing arts in the 18th century. It gained widespread popularity starting in the 1880s. Roller skating was very popular in the United States from the 1930s to the 1950s, then again in the 1970s when it was associated with disco music and roller discos. During the 1990s, inline outdoor roller skating became popular. Roller skating has often been a part of Black and LGBT history in particular.

                <p>
                    The earliest roller skates known are from 18th-century Europe. These skates were used in theater and musical performances, possibly to simulate ice skating onstage. Early roller skating was done in a straight line because turning or curving was very difficult with the primitive skate designs of the time. Limited to an occasional performance prop at the time, roller skating would not see widespread use until the 1840s.

                        The freestyle park is suitable for beginners and experts alike. Together with the neighboring bike park, the parks form one of the largest freestyle facilities in Europe. The 8000 square meter park has a street area with street-like elements such as ramps, stairs and walls as well as a pool area. There are also drinking fountains, public toilets and lockers (bring your own lock).

                        In this indoor park you can not only skate but also have many other options. It also has lots of trampolines where you can practise spins and jumps, for example, which you will later want to do on roller skates.
